## Incident Analysis Report: INC0000045

**Summary:**

Incident INC0000045 is a moderate priority incident with medium impact and urgency.  It was resolved on February 29th, 2016, at 11:29.  The resolution time indicates the incident was handled relatively quickly, but the lack of a "Possible Cause" necessitates further investigation.  The missing cause prevents a proper assessment of the effectiveness of the resolution and whether preventative measures should be implemented.

**Potential Causes:**

Without further information, several potential causes need to be considered:

* **Software Glitch:** A temporary software malfunction could have caused the incident. This might include bugs in an application, operating system issues, or conflicts between software components.
* **Hardware Failure:** A failing hardware component (e.g., server, network device, storage) could have been the root cause.
* **Network Connectivity Issues:** Problems with network connectivity, such as intermittent outages, bandwidth limitations, or routing problems, could have disrupted service.
* **Human Error:**  Mistakes made by users or administrators (e.g., misconfiguration, incorrect settings, accidental deletion) could have triggered the incident.
* **Security Breach:**  Although less likely given the moderate priority, a minor security breach could have caused temporary disruption.
* **Third-Party Dependency Issue:** A problem with a service provided by a third-party vendor could have been the cause.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Determine the Root Cause:** The most critical step is to investigate the incident thoroughly and identify the actual root cause. This should include reviewing logs, interviewing affected users, and checking system monitoring data.  The specific steps will depend on the suspected cause(s).

2. **Document the Root Cause and Resolution:** Once identified, the root cause must be documented in the incident report, along with a detailed description of the resolution steps taken.

3. **Implement Preventative Measures:** Based on the root cause, implement appropriate preventative measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.  This might involve patching software, upgrading hardware, enhancing security measures, or providing additional user training.

4. **Review and Update Procedures:** Assess if any existing procedures or processes contributed to the incident.  Update or create new procedures as necessary to prevent recurrence.

5. **Knowledge Base Update:** Add a summary of the incident and its resolution to the knowledge base to help other support staff resolve similar issues quickly.


This improved analysis highlights the need for complete information within incident reports to allow for effective problem-solving and prevention.  The lack of a "Possible Cause" significantly limits the usefulness of this report.
